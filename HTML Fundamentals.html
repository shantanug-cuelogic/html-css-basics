    <h1><abbr title ='Hypertext MArkup Language' >HTML</abbr></h1>
        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance
             of the document.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents 
             by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page. 
             Other tags such as  surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs
             written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the 
             CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.<a href="#tablecontent">table</a></p>

        "Definition list" redirects here. For Wikipedia's article on lists of definitions, see Glossary.
        A description list (a.k.a. association list), which consists of name–value groups,[21] and was known as a definition list prior to HTML5.[22] Description lists are intended for groups of "terms and definitions, metadata topics and values, questions and answers, or any other groups of name–value data".[23]
        DL existed in HTML Tags, and was standardized in HTML 2.0; still current.
        <dt>...</dt>
        
        A name in a description list (previously definition term in a definition list).

        DD existed in HTML Tags, and was standardized in HTML 2.0; still current.
        <ol>...</ol>
        
        An ordered (enumerated) list. The type attribute can be used to specify the kind of marker to use in the list, but style sheets give more control. The default is Arabic numbering. CSS: list-style-type: foo. HTML attribute: <ol type="foo">, in either case, replacing foo with one of the following:
        A for A, B, C...
        a for a, b, c...
        I for I, II, III...
        i for i, ii, iii...
        1 for 1, 2, 3...
        OL existed in HTML Internet Draft 1.2, and was standardized in HTML 2.0; still current.
        <ul>...</ul>
        
        An unordered (bulleted) list. Style sheets can be used to specify the list marker: list-style-type: foo. The default marker type is disc, other values are square, circle and none.
        UL existed in HTML Tags, and was standardized in HTML 2.0; still current.
        <li>...</li>
